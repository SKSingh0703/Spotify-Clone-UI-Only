# Spotify-Clone

I created a Simple Spotify UI Clone using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on replicating the visual aesthetics and basic functionalities of the Spotify interface. It involved crafting a responsive layout, incorporating custom styles, and utilizing JavaScript to handle dynamic interactions. This project allowed me to hone my front-end development skills and demonstrated my ability to build visually appealing and user-friendly web applications without relying on frameworks or libraries.
